	  GLSL Sandbox standalone player allow one to run and render
	  (most of) nice shaders available online on the
	  http://glslsandbox.com/ website, but without the need of an
	  Internet connection, a web browser or any of its
	  dependencies. Instead, the only requirement of
	  glslsandbox-player is a working EGL and GLESv2 libraries.
